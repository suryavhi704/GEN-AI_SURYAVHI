# 🚀 Successfully Participated in Gen AI Chatbot Creation Contest by Intellipaat! 🤖✨
I’m excited to share that I recently took part in a high-impact Gen AI Coding Contest conducted by Intellipaat, where I built a powerful conversational chatbot using the Google FLAN-T5 base model hosted on Hugging Face. 💬⚙️

# Despite the surprise element of the challenge, I was able to:
✅ Load and fine-tune the FLAN base model effectively
✅ Deploy the chatbot on Google Colab with a smooth execution pipeline
✅ Conduct lengthy and meaningful conversations with zero crashes or errors
✅ Ensure the chatbot maintained contextual flow, intelligent replies, and fast inference

This experience wasn’t just about building a chatbot — it was about pushing boundaries, adapting quickly, and leveraging Gen AI responsibly and efficiently.

# 🔍 Tech Stack & Tools Used:
Hugging Face Transformers 🤗

Google FLAN-T5 model (base) 🧠

Google Colab (GPU accelerated) ⚡

Python + Transformers + Tokenizers 🐍

Prompt engineering & pipeline setup 🔧

# 🧠 What I Learned:
💡 Prompt-tuning for zero-shot/few-shot setups
💡 Model inference optimization in constrained environments
💡 Error handling and resource management in cloud notebooks
💡 Real-time conversational testing for Gen AI use cases

This contest helped me realize how efficient, lightweight, and customizable today's open-source LLMs are for building intelligent systems.
