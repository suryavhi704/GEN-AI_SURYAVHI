# ðŸš€ Advanced Chatbot Development Using GPU-Based Fine-Tuned LLMs | Intellipaat Workshop
I recently leveled up my Generative AI journey by attending an advanced workshop by Intellipaat focused on fine-tuned chatbot creation using GPU-powered LLMs such as Mistral and Google Falcon.

# ðŸ’¡ Unlike earlier model experiments, this time the focus was on working with powerful, pre-trained open-source models fine-tuned specifically for conversational intelligence.

ðŸ”§ Key Highlights from the Experience:
ðŸ”¹ Hands-on experience with Mistral and Google Falcon,
ðŸ”¹ Explored GPU-optimized model serving pipelines and memory-efficient loading techniques,
ðŸ”¹ Managed fine-tuning workflows on limited infrastructure â€” a personal laptop without a dedicated GPU,
ðŸ”¹ Tackled hardware constraints creatively using Colab Pro and parameter-efficient tuning like LoRA,
ðŸ”¹ Observed performance differences between base and fine-tuned versions, especially in context understanding, response fluency, and hallucination minimization,
ðŸ”¹ Successfully deployed a functioning chatbot pipeline using inference-ready checkpoints.

# This session gave me a deep dive into LLM scaling challenges, optimizing GPU resources, and building smarter assistants that push open-source AI boundaries.

ðŸ’» Despite the hardware challenges, this experience taught me that dedication and the cloud can take you far â€” even with no GPU on board
