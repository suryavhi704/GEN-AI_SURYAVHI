# ðŸš€ Exploring the Evolution of Chatbots through Gen AI | Intellipaat Workshop

I recently attended an intensive workshop conducted by Intellipaat on Generative AI, with a focused hands-on session on chatbot development using Google's FLAN series of models.

The workshop journey was an eye-opener into the revolution of conversational AI, where I explored:

ðŸ”¹ A progressive model scaling from FLAN-T5 Small â†’ Base â†’ Large,
ðŸ”¹ Built and tested chatbots at each stage to observe response quality, reasoning ability, and hallucination control,
ðŸ”¹ Implemented model-specific logic and tokenizer handling for each variant,
ðŸ”¹ Engaged in real-time conversations with all three versions to benchmark dialogue fluidity,
ðŸ”¹ Witnessed how the larger FLAN-T5 model significantly enhanced contextual retention and response coherence.

What stood out was how scalable LLMs shape chatbot intelligenceâ€”starting from simple prompt-response setups to LLMs capable of human-like discussions.

This hands-on experience not only deepened my understanding of LLM architecture but also demonstrated the real-world potential of integrating foundation models into intelligent assistants.
